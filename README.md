# Simple UP-Comm

Simple UP-Comm is a Java-based project showcasing unidirectional UDP communication between a client and a server. The repository consists of two main components, the client, and the server, each residing in their respective directories.

## Project Structure

- **client/**: Contains the client-side code.
  - `Main.java`: Entry point for the client application.
  - `UDPClient.java`: Class handling UDP communication on the client side.

- **server/**: Contains the server-side code.
  - `Main.java`: Entry point for the server application.
  - `UDPServer.java`: Class handling UDP communication on the server side.

## Explanation

### UDPClient

The `UDPClient` class is responsible for sending unidirectional UDP packets to a server. It generates random data based on the specified data type (Integer, Long, Float, or Double) and sends packets in an infinite loop. The generated data and the timestamp of each packet are printed to the console.

### UDPServer

The `UDPServer` class is responsible for receiving unidirectional UDP packets from clients. It extracts sender information, such as client IP address and port, and prints the received data along with the timestamp. The server runs in an infinite loop, continuously listening for incoming packets.

## Usage

To use the Simple UP-Comm project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-up-comm.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired component directory:

    ```bash
    cd simple-up-comm/client   # or cd simple-up-comm/server
    ```

3. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

Ensure you have Java installed on your system before attempting to compile and run the Simple UP-Comm project. For development, consider using an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code.
